// yWing removes candidates. If a cell has two candidates (AB) and in a neighboring unit (box, row, or column) of AB is another cell containing AC and in a second neighboring unit of AB is a cell containing BC, then any cell that can be "seen" by AC and BC (in both neighborhoods of AC and BC) that contain C can have C removed. It returns true if it changes any cells.
