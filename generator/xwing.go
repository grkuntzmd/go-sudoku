// xWing removes candidates. If in 2 columns, say 0 and 7, all instances of a particular digit, say 4, appear in the same two rows, say 4 and 6, then 1 of the 4's must be in (0, 4) or (0, 6) and the other in (7, 4) or (7, 6). Therefore all of the other 4's in those two rows can be removed. The same logic applies if rows and columns are swapped. It returns true if it changes any cells.
func (g *Grid) xWing(verbose uint) bool {
	return g.xWingGroup(&col, &row, verbose) || g.xWingGroup(&row, &col, verbose)
